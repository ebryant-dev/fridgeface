# Fridgeface

Five shapes. Infinite possibilities.

Fridgeface is a modular typeface built from just five shapes. Black shapes add form, white shapes cut it away. This repo is the interactive version: a board where you place, move, rotate and restack pieces to build words and pictograms.

Design and concept by [Edward Hamel](https://www.edwardbryanthamel.com). The domain glossary is in [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md) and architecture decisions are in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/).

Status: early development (chunk 2: place, select, move, delete and restack pieces).

## Development

Requires Node 22 or newer.

```sh
npm install     # install dependencies
npm run dev     # serve the demo page (index.html) with hot reload
npm test        # run the unit tests (Vitest)
npm run build   # type-check, then build the ES module to dist/fridgeface.js
```

The build defines the `<fridge-face>` custom element (Shadow DOM, styles inside the shadow root).
